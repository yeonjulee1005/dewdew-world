# Let's do highlight code blocks!

Basically, [Astro](https://astro.build/) provides syntax highlighting for markdown code blocks.
To utilize this, we can generally work with either Shiki or Prism, but [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/) provides examples using Shiki.

Since Shiki allows use of themes from VSCode, I recommend it more convenient to use Shiki.
Let's learn how to highlight code blocks!

## Find Highlight Theme

First, find and copy name of theme you want to use from [here](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md).
(I use `min-light`.)

## Editing `astro.config.mjs` file

Next, you need to add following content to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

```typescript
//...
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  integrations: [
    tailwind()
  ],
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      theme: 'min-light', // 이곳이 중요합니다!
      langs: [],
      wrap: true
    }
  }
})
```

## That's all!

With the above settings, you can see such wonderful code block highlighting!
