# Nuxt v3.10 is Out!

[Nuxt v3.10](https://nuxt.com/) has been released!

In this minor version, new features have been added along with `some experimental features`.
Let's take a look at the new features that I'm keeping an eye on.

---

## New feature in v3.10

### 1. Generating SSR Safe unique Id with `useId()`

Using `useId()` allows you to generate a unique id safely in an SSR environment.
This provides a more accessible interface.
The example below is from the official [Nuxt3 blog](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-10).

```typescript
// ./components/Form.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
const emailId = useId()
const passwordId = useId()
</script>

<template>
  <form>
    <label :for="emailId">Email</label>
    <input
      :id="emailId"
      name="email"
      type="email"
    >
    <label :for="passwordId">Password</label>
    <input
      :id="passwordId"
      name="password"
      type="password"
    >
  </form>
</template>
```

### 2. Opt-in `CookieStore` and new feature `refreshCookie()`

Nuxt3 is allow using CookieStore. If browser support, this will be used instead of a `BoardcastChannel` tu update `useCookie()`.

And also comes new composable `refreshCookie()`. which allows manually refreshing cookie values, such as after performing a request like below.

```typescript
// app.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
const tokenCookie = useCookie('token')

const login = async (username, password) => {
  const token = await $fetch('/api/token', { ... }) // Sets `token` cookie on response
  refreshCookie('token') // this will update the value of `tokenCookie`
}

const loggedIn = computed(() => !!tokenCookie.value)
</script>
```

### 3. Detecting anti-patterns

Now will throw an error if `setInterval is used on server side`.

and `in development mode`, it detects anti-patterns and displays warnings like below.

- Warning if data `fetch composables are used wrongly`, such as outside of a plugin or setup context.
- warning if not using `<NuxtPage />`, but have to `vue-router` integration enabled.

### 4. [Experimental] Granular `view transitions`

It can set granular `view transitions` for each page using `DefinePageMeta`.

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  experimental: {
    viewTransition: true
  },
  app: {
    // you can disable them globally if necessary (they are enabled by default)
    viewTransition: false
  }
})
```

```typescript
// ./pages/index.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  viewTransition: false
})
</script>
```

### 5. [Experimental] `asyncData` when prerendering

`In Nuxt 2`, it was possible to create a 'payload' which could be fetched once and then accessed in every page.
By setting it as follows, `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` calls will be `deduplicated and cached` between renders of your site.

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts

export defineNuxtConfig({
  experimental: {
    sharedPrerenderData: true
  }
})
```
