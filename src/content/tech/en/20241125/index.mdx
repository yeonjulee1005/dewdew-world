## What is ESR?
As all developers now know, the differences between `CSR` and `SSR` are well understood.<br />
However, it seems that many people are still unaware of `ESR`, so I would like to introduce it.

`ESR (Edge Side Rendering)` is a method of rendering content on edge servers that are located close to the user.<br />
It is similar to `SSR`, but the difference is that while SSR is mainly performed on `Deployment servers (origin servers)`, `ESR` is rendered on edge networks that are physically closer to the client.

ESR is a technology that emerged to solve the problem of long data retrieval times when there is no cached data on the server, which was a drawback of SSR.<br />
In addition, when many users access the site, there may be server overload, but by using ESR, it is possible to effectively handle large-scale traffic through user dispersion.

Therefore, let's briefly summarize the differences between SSR and ESR as follows.

| Feature | SSR | ESR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rendering Location | Deployment server | Edge server |
| Initial Load Speed | Normal | Fast |
| SEO Performance | Good | Good |

## How to use ESR with Nuxt3
Let's see how to use ESR in [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/).<br />
Note that ESR is more a deployment target than an actual rendering mode.

Edge-side rendering is possible thanks to Nitro, the server engine that powers Nuxt 3.<br />
It offers cross-platform support for Node.js, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, and more.<br />
With ESR, the rendering process is pushed to the edge of the `network - the CDN's edge servers`.<br />

So actually, little additional work is required in the Nuxt3 source.<br />
However, it is necessary to establish a [hybrid rendering environment](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) in Nuxt3 source.

This is because if the site cache already exists, it will quickly display using the `pre-generated cache from the server`.<br />
If there is no site cache, it will request data from the deployment server to render the HTML.

The following diagram shows how ESR works.

## Setting ESR in Vercel
As mentioned earlier, little additional work is required in the `Nuxt3 source`.<br />
Add the following build command when deploying to Vercel.

```bash
// package.json
...
"scripts": {
  "build": "NITRO_PRESET=vercel-edge nuxt build",
  }
...
```

By adding the build command as above and deploying.<br />
`Vercel-edge` environment will be automatically set up when deploying on Vercel, as shown in the picture below.

## That's all!

As you can easily set it up like this, try using ESR with Nuxt3 and Vercel!

See you nuxt! (not next)
