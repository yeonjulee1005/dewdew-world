# Nuxt v3.12 is Out!

[Nuxt v3.12](https://nuxt.com/) has been released!

The Nuxt core team is preparing for the release of [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade), but they have released Nuxt 3.12.

Let's take a look at the new features that I'm keeping an eye on.

---

## New feature in v3.12

### 1. Testing `Nuxt4` changes

In Nuxt 3.12, you can add the following configuration to `nuxt.config.ts` to test the features of `Nuxt4`.

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  future: {
    compatibilityVersion: 4,
  },
})
```

Interestingly, the folder structure of `Nuxt4` has changed.
The folder structure of `Nuxt4` is as follows:

```mdx
.output/
.nuxt/
app/
  assets/
  components/
  composables/
  layouts/
  middleware/
  pages/
  plugins/
  utils/
  app.config.ts
  app.vue
  router.options.ts
modules/
node_modules/
public/
server/
  api/
  middleware/
  plugins/
  routes/
  utils/
nuxt.config.ts
```

With the introduction of the `/app` folder, you can now experimentally use the `MultiApp` feature.

Please check out the features of Nuxt4 that you can test at [this link](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade#migrating-to-nuxt-4)!


### 2. `Nuxt Scripts` auto-install

`Nuxt Scripts` is a project that allows faster loading of third-party applications (Analytics, Tracking, Ads, Payments, Contents).
It is currently in public preview, but it is expected to be released soon, and it will enable automatic installation of `Nuxt Scripts` in preparation for that time.

For example, you can also load the YouTube Player quickly without using the `<iframe>` tag by using `Nuxt Scripts`.

```typescript
<template>
  <ScriptYouTubePlayer video-id="d_IFKP1Ofq0">
    <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-5">
      Video by Nuxt
    </div>
  </ScriptYouTubePlayer>
</template>
```

`video-id` is a unique identifier for videos on YouTube.

For more information about `Nuxt Scripts`, please check [this link](https://scripts.nuxt.com/).


### 3. Adding `NuxtRouteAnnouncer` and Automatic Layer Registration, performance improvements

All layers within the project are automatically registered in the `/layers` folder.
Additionally, you can now use the new [`NuxtRouteAnnouncer`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-route-announcer) component.

There are also various performance improvements,
such as more extensive tree-shaking of client-only composables during server builds and reducing the size of server component payloads.

## That's all!

It seems that the era of Nuxt4 is approaching.
I will conclude today's post looking forward to the upcoming release of Nuxt4.

See you nuxt! (not next)
