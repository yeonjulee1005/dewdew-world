## Why did it take so long for `Nuxt4`?
`Nuxt core team` aimed to release `Nuxt4` in June of last year (2024).<br />
The delay was primarily due to the postponed release of `Nitro3`,<br />
and I understand that it was also delayed due to `various bug` fixes, the main version work of `Nuxt Icon`, and the release of `Nuxt Ui v3`.

## We can already use `Nuxt4`!
Actually, as I mentioned in the previous article, if you add the following code to `nuxt.config.ts`, you can use `Nuxt4` perfectly.<br />

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  future: {
    compatibilityVersion: 4,
  },
  // ...
})
```

## I have already experienced it!
Since last year, I have been using `Nuxt4` as a `future` version, and I have been able to use it stably in the field.<br />
In addition, as I explained in the article below,<br />
I was very satisfied with the fact that it was easy to migrate from `Nuxt3` to `Nuxt4` with just a simple structure change and some configuration adjustments.

[Previous article](/tech/20240618)

## What improvements are included in `Nuxt4`?
`Nuxt4` has the following improvements!<br />

1. A new `/app` directory structure has been added.
2. `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` provide better caching and processing methods.
3. Head and tag optimization provide better `SEO` performance.
4. `Vite environment API` is being prepared for introduction.

Originally, it was planned to introduce `Nitro3` to `Nuxt4`, but after `Nuxt4` is officially released, `Nitro3` will be applied immediately.<br />
This is because `Nitro3` is a more stable and advanced version than `Nitro2`.

## So, until when will `Nuxt3` be supported?
It seems that the support for `Nuxt3` and the upcoming `Nuxt4` and `Nuxt5` will proceed as follows!<br />
They say that the migration process is becoming easier, which is why they have set such a short period!

| Version | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Nuxt3 | Support until the end of 2025 |
| Nuxt4 | Support until mid-2026 |
| Nuxt5 | No plans yet |


## That's all!

As you can see, `Nuxt4` will be officially available soon!<br />
Of course, you can enjoy `Nuxt4` now! (?)

See you nuxt! (not next)
