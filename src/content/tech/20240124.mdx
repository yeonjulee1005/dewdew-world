# What is `Arc` ?

[Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) is well-crafted browser `based on Chromium`.
It supports all the basic features of Chrome (such as `Chrome extensions`, Chrome bookmarks, etc.), and goes further to offer unique features of `Arc`.

Key additional features include screen splitting, `workspace management`, account-based workspace saving and sharing, visible management of Chrome extensions, `boost mode`, and full-screen view, etc.

For more details, please refer to [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/).

## Was it not available on Windows?

Unfortunately, until now, the Arc browser has only supported `MacOS` and `Linux`.
This meant that Windows users were unable to use Arc browser.

But today, we have exciting news: the beta version of Arc browser for Windows is now available.
