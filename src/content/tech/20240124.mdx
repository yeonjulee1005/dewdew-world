# Why Astro?

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a new concept framework that helps generate static sites,
taking the advantages of traditional SSR (Server Side Rendering) and CSR (Client Side Rendering) while compensating for their disadvantages.
`Astro generates static HTML` at build time and dynamically renders the built HTML in the browser.

This allows you to achieve `fast loading speeds and SEO optimization` at the same time.
In other words, it's good to use Astro when creating sites with static content like blogs or portfolios.

Astro Island allows you to use familiar frameworks like Vue or React.
We create interactive components using familiar frameworks through Astro Island.

However, since the ultimate goal of Astro is to create static websites, using Vue or React can sometimes be inefficient I guess.

## Let's install Astro.

Astro can be easily installed and run through various package managers such as npm, yarn, etc.
However, since I quite like [Bun](https://bun.sh/), I will proceed with the installation and execution through `Bun`.

```zsh
// initialize Astro project
bunx create-astro@latest your-project-name
```

## How to Write `.astro` Files

let's learn how to markup using Astro.
Basically, `.astro` files separate the script area and the markup area with `---` symbols like this.

And you can assign variable names or components within `{}` to express them.

```typescript
---
import Header from '@components/Header.astro'

const headerTitle = 'This is Title!'
const something = 'something'

const displayPrice = (name: string) => {
  switch (name) {
    case 'apple':
      return 1000
    case 'banana':
      return 2000
  }
}

---
<div class="display-dom">
  <Header title={headerTitle} />
  <h1>
    {something}
  </h1>
  <p>
    {displayPrice('apple')}
  </p>
</div>

<style>
.display-dom {
  color: red;
}
</style>

```
