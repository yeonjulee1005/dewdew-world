# In Vue Nation 2024...

There were several impressive sessions on `Day 2`.

A slight disappointment was that there were many introductions to `UI libraries` rather than technical solutions, which made it a bit boring.
However, seeing that even the libraries I didn't use, `have a lot of development plans for 2024`, I thought I should create an opportunity to use and introduce them later. (`Prime Vue` and `Vuetify` caught my interest!) 

After Day 2, I gained the following insights, which I plan to introduce sequentially after this post!

- Build type-safe components (With generic types)
- Testing Vue 3 Apps with Playwright & Vitest
- Common mistakes in using Vue.js, and how to avoid them

First, let's take a look at today's topic, `Build type-safe components (With generic types)`.

## In Vue 3.3 supports `Generically Typed Components`

First of all, before this post, I would like to express my gratitude to `Abdelrahman Awad` who made it possible for me to write this post.
It was such a great session!


[Vue 3.3](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-3) was officially released in March 2023. One of the announcements was the support for [Generically Typed Vue Components](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-3#generic-components).

As explained in the above blog, you can now set type parameters through the `generic` attribute in the `<script setup>` tag. Like this.

```vue
<script setup lang='ts' generic='T'>
defineProps<{
  items: T[].
  selectedItem: T
}>()
</script>
```

Also, It can extend `multiple parameters`, constraints, default types, and imported types using `extends` as shown below.

```vue
<script setup lang='ts' generic='T extends string | number, U extends Item'>
import type { Item } from './types'

defineProps<{
  label: T,
  itemList: U[]
}>()
</script>
```

Through this, it `clearly type-checks` whether two or more props passed to the component are actually same type. (If the types are different, `Volar plugin` marks it with a red line!)

## Let's try it!

Below is a simple example I wrote myself.
(I used [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) in the example. `I will post` about this later!)

### Case 1: Input

```vue
// /components/A/Card.vue

<script setup lang="ts" generic="T extends string | number">

defineProps<{
  label: T
  cardType: T
}>()

const model = defineModel<T extends 'number' ? number : string>()

</script>

<template>
  <p>
    {{ label }}:
  </p>
  <div>
    <DDInput
      v-model="model"
      :type="(cardType as string)"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue
///page/index.vue

<script setup lang="ts">

const text = ref('')
const count = ref(0)

</script>

<template>
  <div class="w-full min-h-screen flex justify-center items-center gap-8">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <ACard
        v-model="text"
        label="string"
        :card-type="'string'"
      />
      <pre>
        {{ { value: text, type: typeof text } }}
      </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
      <ACard
        v-model="count"
        label="number"
        :card-type="'number'"
      />
      <pre>
        {{ { value: count, type: typeof count } }}
      </pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

```

Above example is structured as follows.

- `ACard.vue` component receives `label` and `cardType` as props and accepts a reactive value through `defineModel`.
- In `index.vue`, if a specific type of value is not passed, it is marked with a red line, and type inference is possible. Also, the `modelValue` of the `ACard` component infers the necessary type based on the type provided by `index.vue`.
(I searched, and it seems that the [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) VSCode plugin automatically indicates missing parameters, but it seems that I can't do that, and I need to look into it more.)

### Case 2: SelectMenu

Following example is simple one using `SelectMenu`. This also allows type inference of the component using Generic Component.

```vue
// /components/A/List.vue

<script setup lang="ts" generic="T extends Option">
import type { Option } from '~/types/index'

const props = defineProps<{
  modelValue: T
  options: T[]
}>()

const emit = defineEmits<{
  'update:model': [value: T]
}>()

const computedModel = computed({
  get () {
    return props.modelValue
  },
  set (value: T) {
    emit('update:model', value)
  }
})

</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <DDSelectMenu
      v-model="computedModel"
      :options="options"
    >
      <template #leading>
        <span>
          {{ computedModel.id }}
        </span>
      </template>
    </DDSelectMenu>
  </div>
</template>
```

```vue
// /pages/select.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
import type { Option } from '~/types/index'

const options: Option[] = [
  { id: 1, label: 'banana' },
  { id: 2, label: 'orange' },
  { id: 3, label: 'apple' },
  { id: 10, label: 'strowberry' }
]

const selectedOption = ref<Option>(options[0])

</script>

<template>
  <div class="h-screen w-full flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-8">
    <AList
      v-model="selectedOption"
      :options="options"
      @update:model="(value) => selectedOption = value"
    />
    <pre>
      {{ { value: selectedOption, type: typeof selectedOption } }}
    </pre>
  </div>
</template>
```

```typescript
// /types/index.ts

export interface Option {
  id: string | number
  label: string
}
```

![type safe!](/tech/images/20240128-3.png)

If you pass a value of different type to `modelValue`, it will be marked with a red line like this, allowing for type inference.

```vue
// /pages/select.vue

<script setup lang="ts">
import type { Option } from '~/types/index'

const options: Option[] = [
  { id: 1, label: 'banana' },
  { id: 2, label: 'orange' },
  { id: 3, label: 'apple' },
  { id: 10, label: 'strowberry' }
]

const selectedOption = ref<Option>(options[0])
const selectedSometing = ref<{id: number, value: string}>({ id: 1, value: 'banana' })

</script>

<template>
  <div class="h-screen w-full flex flex-col justify-center items-center gap-8">
    <AList
      v-model="selectedSometing"
      :options="options"
      @update:model="(value) => selectedOption = value"
    />
    <pre>
      {{ { value: selectedOption, type: typeof selectedOption } }}
    </pre>
  </div>
</template>
```

## That's all!

I haven't fully using it yet, but I believe `Generic Component` will greatly enhance `DX experience`.
It seems worth checking why the feature in the `Volar plugin` that infers missing parameters is not working properly!!

These were the insights I gained from this session.
If there are any issues or areas for improvement, `please leave a comment`!
Feedback is always welcome!

See you next!
