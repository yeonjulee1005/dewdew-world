# Nuxt3!

[Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/) is a framework based on [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/), offering powerful features for building web applications.
Some reason I `love Nuxt3` is that it provides most of `necessary functionalities` without need for additional function implementations.

In the past, Nuxt2, we had to install axios separately for HTTP communication,
but with `Nuxt3`, you don't need to install axios as it supports HTTP requests through [oFetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch).

Moreover, it comes with a variety of well-equipped built-in modules and composables functions (such as [Nuxt devtools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/), [nuxt icon](https://nuxt.com/modules/icon), [nuxt image](https://image.nuxt.com/), [nuxt time](https://github.com/danielroe/nuxt-time), [nuxt simple sitemap](https://nuxtseo.com/sitemap/getting-started/installation), [nuxt ui](https://ui.nuxt.com/), etc.),
making it very convenient and efficient to set up a development environment.

I will introduce the modules mentioned above in separate `posts in the future`.

That's why I have become an advocate for Nuxt3 in R.O.Korea.

## New feature in Version 3.9

### 1. `Dedupe` use in `useFetch()` composable

As you may know, in Nuxt3, there are ways to fetch data using composable functions such as `$fetch()`, `useFetch()`, `useAsyncData()`.

Among them, `useFetch()` and `useAsyncData()` can reactively fetch data by detecting specific parameters through `watch()`.

As shown below, you can use not only basic fetch options in `useFetch()`, but also various additional options.

```typescript
const { data, pending, refresh, error } = useFetch('/api/users', {
  // .. Basic fetch options
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }, // headers,
  baseUrl: 'https://example.com' // baseUrl,
  query: {
    filter: 'nuxt'
  } // Query,
  body: {
    name: 'dewdew'
  },

  // .. Advanced fetch options support by useFetch
  lazy: true // lazy fetch,
  immediate: true // immediate fetch,
  deep: true // deep watch,
  watch: ['name'] // watch params,
  transform: (input: dataT) => dataT // transform data,
  dedupe: true // today's topic!
})
```

If you use `dedupe` option of this `useFetch()` composable as `cancel`, it cancels previous fetch request and starts a new fetch request.

```typescript
useFetch('/api/users', {
  dedupe: 'cancel'
})
```

And if you set option to `defer`, it will not start a new fetch request until previous fetch request is completed.

```typescript
useFetch('/api/users', {
  dedupe: 'defer'
})
```

This allows you to control data fetch request method `more efficiently`.

### 2. `callOnce()` composable

There may be cases where a function needs to be executed `only once`. For this purpose, a `callOnce()` composable function has been added.

```typescript
<script setup lang="ts">
await callOnce(async () => {
  // The code written here will be executed only once, not only in the SSR environment, but in all cases.
})
</script>
```
When using this composable, code will be executed only once, regardless of whether it's in the `SSR environment` or when the `client` navigates to new page.

Unlike `middleware`, which is called only once when the page route is loaded, the `callOnce()` feature can be executed at any place where a composable can be placed.

It has a similar key to `useFetch()` and `useAsyncData()`, allowing you to track what has been executed and what has not.

```typescript
<script setup>
cosnt items = ['one', 'two', 'three']

items.forEach(item => {
  // Run once for each item
  callOnce(item, async () => {
    console.log(item)
    // Do something with the `item`
  })
})
</script>
```

### 3. Loading Api

Using `useLoadingIndicator()` composable to obtain information on how the page is loading.

```typescript
const { progress, isLoading, start, set, finish, clear } = useLoadingIndicator({
  duration: 1000,
  throttle: 100
})
```

Above composable is internally used by the `<NuxtLoadingIndicator>` component.

`duration` option allows you to specifically set time needed to `calculate percentage`.

`throttle` option controls speed at which progress value updates. This is useful in cases of frequent smooth interactions.

Difference between `finish` and `clear` is significant. `clear` resets all internal timers but does not reset the values.

`finish` is necessary for creating more elegant UX.

For example, set `progress` to `100` and `isLoading` to `true`, then wait for 500ms.
After the time passes, it `resets all values` to their initial state.

### 4. NuxtLayout fallback

When dealing with complex web applications using `Nuxt3`, you will likely be using many layouts.

If selected layout's source has bug, the layout will not render, and neither will the wrapped page.
In such cases, you can set up an alternative layout as a `fallback` to handle these exceptions instead of the non-functioning layout.

```typescript
<NuxtLayout name="ErrorLayout" fallback="switchLayout">
  // If there is an error in ErrorLayout, it will be replaced with switchLayout.
  <NuxtPage />
</NuxtLayout>
```

### 5. `Vue3 v3.4` support!

Nuxt3 now officially supports [Vue3 v3.4](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-4), allowing you to utilize the new features of `Vue3 3.4`.

### 6. Debug hydration error in production Nuxt

`Hydration errors` in an SSR production environment are among the most difficult to control.

With the support of the aforementioned `Vue3 3.4` version, we can debug hydration by simply making the following settings.

```typescript
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  debug: true,
  // ...
})
```

## That's all!

Today's post introduced the features added in the `latest version of Nuxt3`.
